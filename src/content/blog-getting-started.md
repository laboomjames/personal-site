# Getting Started with Static Sites

Static sites are perfect for many use cases, from personal blogs to documentation sites. Here's why I love them:

## Benefits of Static Sites

1. **Fast Loading Times**: No database queries or server-side processing
2. **Improved Security**: No dynamic content means fewer security risks
3. **Lower Costs**: Can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages
4. **Simple Deployment**: Just build and upload static files

## How This Site Works

This site is built using:
- Node.js for the build process
- Markdown for content
- Simple HTML templates
- CSS for styling
